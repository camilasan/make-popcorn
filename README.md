# What is Make?

Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program. 

It was originally created by Stuart Feldman in April 1976 at Bell Labs. He was inspired to write Make by the experience of a coworker in futilely debugging a program of his where the executable was accidentally not being updated with changes.

# The recipe 

It is very simple: 
- 1 Computer to taste
- 1 Operating System to taste 
- 1 Make Binary (Make installed in your Computer :)
- 1 Shell Program to taste
- 1 Text or Code editor to taste
- 1 File called ```Makefile```

## Instructions

1. Check if your computer have Make installed.  In the beginning there was only a software called "Make" but then later due to its popularity Unix included Make as part of the default installation. Therefore Mac OS have it by default andany Linux distro will have it too.

2. Shell is a program that interprets commands and acts as an intermediary between the user and the inner workings of the operating system. Providing a command-line interface (i.e., the shell prompt or command prompt), the shell is analogous to DOS and serves a purpose similar to graphical interfaces like Windows, Mac OS X, and the X Window System.

3. You need a makefile to tell make what to do. Most often, the makefile tells make how to compile and link a program.

4. With the editor of choice, create a file called Makefile. Keep in mind that Make uses tabs instead of spaces, so if your editor is set up to replace spaces with tabs then you could find things donâ€™t work as expected.
