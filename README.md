This is a beginner's make tutorial.

# Ingredients

Today's chef suggestion is to create a folder and list its files in it. The topping for it could be to create a scss file and use sass to compile it to css or to start a Vue project from scratch and using npm to install it. 

For that you will need:
- 1 Computer to taste
- 1 Operating System to taste 
- 1 Make Binary (Make installed in your Computer :)
- 1 Shell Program to taste
- 1 Text or Code editor to taste
- 1 File called Makefile
- 1 Project in a programming language to taste
- 1 Task to automate to taste. 


## Directions

1. Open your shell program of choice.

2. Check if your computer have Make installed. 

Mac OS have it by default and any Linux distro will have (should have?) it too. Windows doesn't support shell.

Type on the shell program:
```
make --version
```

2. With the editor of choice, create a file called Makefile and save it the root of the folder of your Project of choice.

In this step you can use your file manager or your shell program of choice to create the file. 

3. Pick the task you want to automate. For this tutorial, let's try to create a directory:

```

```




# Nutrition Facts

1. Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program. 

2. Make was originally designed to automate the build process of compiled languages (code -> binary) but since the "advent" of web development and the infinite numbers of Javascript frameworks it s use had been expanded to so much more. 

3. Make commands are structured shell scripts with extra syntactical sugar. In other words, make can execute any command you would usually execute directly in your shell program.

4. Shell is a program that interprets commands and acts as an intermediary between the user and the inner workings of the operating system. e.g. create a directory, list the files in it. So when you read "Unix Shell" it stands for a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a traditional Unix-like command line user interface.  The shell is analogous to DOS and serves a purpose similar to graphical interfaces like Windows, Mac OS X, and the X Window System.

5. You need a makefile to tell make what to do. Keep in mind that Make uses tabs instead of spaces, so if your editor is set up to replace spaces with tabs then you could find things donâ€™t work as expected. 

6. Make was originally created by Stuart Feldman in April 1976 at Bell Labs. He was inspired to write Make by the experience of a coworker in futilely debugging a program of his where the executable was accidentally not being updated with changes.

7. In the beginning there was only a software called Make but then later due to its popularity Unix included Make as part of the default installation. I believe that is why it is called GNU Make.
